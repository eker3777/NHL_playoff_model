## Cross-Page Consistency Review

To ensure all pages work together seamlessly, we need to review the following areas across all pages:

### 1. Import Consistency

| Requirement | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Config Imports | All pages should import constants from config.py |
| Utility Imports | Consistent importing of utility functions |
| Module Organization | Similar modules should be organized in the same way across pages |
| Import Order | Follow consistent ordering (stdlib, third-party, local) |

### 2. Data Handling Consistency

| Requirement | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Data Loading | Use cache_manager consistently for data loading |
| Data Validation | Apply validate_and_fix() consistently after loading data |
| Error Handling | Use similar patterns for handling missing or invalid data |
| Session State | Consistent approach to storing and retrieving from session state |

### 3. Prediction and Simulation Consistency

| Requirement | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Model Application | Use the same pattern for applying the prediction model |
| Home Ice Advantage | Apply HOME_ICE_ADVANTAGE consistently |
| Series Length | Use SERIES_LENGTH_DIST consistently for simulations |
| Feature Engineering | Apply the same feature engineering steps before prediction |

### 4. UI Consistency

| Requirement | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Percentage Display | Use format_percentage_for_display() for all percentage values |
| Team Representation | Consistent approach to team names, abbreviations, and logos |
| Chart Styling | Use the same styling for similar charts across pages |
| Error Messages | Consistent format and tone for error messages |

## Cross-Page Consistency Review Process

For each page, we will perform the following review process:

1. **Import and Dependency Analysis**
   - Review all imports for consistency with other pages
   - Ensure all constants come from config.py
   - Check for any hardcoded values that should be centralized

2. **Data Flow Analysis**
   - Map the complete data flow from loading to display
   - Verify validation is applied consistently
   - Check for proper error handling at all stages

3. **Prediction Pattern Analysis**
   - Verify the prediction model is applied consistently
   - Check that home ice advantage is applied correctly
   - Ensure series length distribution follows the standard pattern

4. **UI Component Analysis**
   - Check for consistent formatting of all displayed values
   - Verify the same components are used for similar purposes
   - Ensure error messages follow a consistent pattern

The results of this review will be documented and used to guide fixes before deployment.

## Conclusion

The overall page structure is well-designed but requires a thorough consistency review to ensure all pages work together seamlessly. This process will identify any remaining inconsistencies in data handling, model application, and UI presentation before proceeding to deployment.

Key priorities are:
1. Ensuring all pages import constants from config.py
2. Verifying consistent application of utility functions
3. Checking for consistent data validation across pages
4. Confirming a unified approach to prediction and simulation
5. Ensuring a consistent user experience across all pages
