# NHL Playoff Model - Bottom-Up Verification Checklist

This document provides a structured approach for verifying consistency across the NHL Playoff Model codebase from the bottom up.

## Config Layer (Foundation)

- [ ] `config.py`: Verify all constants are defined and documented
  - [ ] HOME_ICE_ADVANTAGE = 0.039
  - [ ] SERIES_LENGTH_DISTRIBUTION = [0.140, 0.243, 0.336, 0.281]
  - [ ] Other application constants

## Utilities Layer (Core functionality)

### Data Handlers
- [ ] `data_handlers.py`: Check data loading and validation
  - [ ] Percentage storage in 0-1 scale
  - [ ] Error handling for data loading
  - [ ] Data validation functions

### Model Utilities
- [ ] `model_utils.py`: Verify prediction functions
  - [ ] HOME_ICE_ADVANTAGE imported from config.py
  - [ ] Consistent feature engineering
  - [ ] Feature validation before model application

### Visualization
- [ ] `visualization.py`: Check visualization functions
  - [ ] Consistent percentage formatting
  - [ ] Team colors handling
  - [ ] Chart layout consistency

### Other Utilities
- [ ] `debug_utils.py`: Check debugging utilities

## Simulation Layer (Prediction engine)

- [ ] `simulation.py`: Verify simulation logic
  - [ ] HOME_ICE_ADVANTAGE imported from config.py

  - [ ] Series outcome probability calculations

## Page Layer (User interface)

- [ ] `first_round.py`: Verify first round matchup page
  - [ ] Constants imported from config.py
  - [ ] Consistent data loading and error handling
  - [ ] Proper visualization usage

- [ ] `simulation_results.py`: Check simulation results page
  - [ ] Constants imported from config.py
  - [ ] Simulation execution and display
  - [ ] Consistent error handling

- [ ] `head_to_head.py`: Verify head-to-head comparison page
  - [ ] Constants imported from config.py
  - [ ] Matchup calculations consistency
  - [ ] UI consistency with other pages

- [ ] `sim_bracket.py`: Check bracket simulation page
  - [ ] Constants imported from config.py
  - [ ] Bracket advancement logic
  - [ ] Prediction consistency

- [ ] `about.py`: Verify about page for accuracy
- [ ] `debug.py`: Check debug page functionality

## Main Application

- [ ] `app.py`: Verify main entry point
  - [ ] Page navigation setup
  - [ ] Initial data loading
  - [ ] Session state initialization

Legend: ✅ = Verified, 🔄 = In Progress, ❌ = Issues Found, N/A = Not Applicable

## Verification Methodology

For each file, follow this verification checklist:

1. **Imports**: Are all necessary modules imported? Are constants imported from config.py?
2. **Constants**: Are any constants hardcoded that should be from config.py?
3. **Data Handling**: Is data loaded, validated, and processed consistently?
4. **Error Handling**: Are there appropriate try/except blocks with user-friendly messages?
5. **Caching**: Is caching implemented appropriately?
6. **Functionality**: Does the core functionality work as expected?
7. **UI Components**: Are UI elements consistent with other pages?

This systematic approach will ensure all components work together coherently and consistently.
