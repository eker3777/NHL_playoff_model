# NHL Playoff Model - Deployment Roadmap

## Current Status: Bottom-Up Verification Phase

We're currently implementing a systematic bottom-up verification approach to ensure all components work together coherently and consistently.

### Completed
- ‚úÖ Project structure established
- ‚úÖ Basic utility modules created
- ‚úÖ Page layouts designed
- ‚úÖ Initial implementation of key components

### In Progress
- üîÑ Bottom-up verification of all components
- üîÑ Fixing inconsistencies identified during verification

### Upcoming
- ‚è±Ô∏è Final testing with real NHL data
- ‚è±Ô∏è Performance optimization
- ‚è±Ô∏è Deployment to production

## Bottom-Up Verification Timeline

1. **Config Layer** (1 day)
   - Verify all constants in config.py
   - Check imports in all files

2. **Utilities Layer** (2 days)
   - Verify data_handlers.py
   - Verify model_utils.py
   - Verify visualization.py
   - Verify other utility modules

3. **Simulation Layer** (1 day)
   - Verify simulation.py and related modules

4. **Page Layer** (2 days)
   - Verify first_round.py
   - Verify simulation_results.py
   - Verify head_to_head.py
   - Verify sim_bracket.py
   - Verify about.py and debug.py

5. **Main App** (1 day)
   - Verify app.py

## Critical Path Tasks

### 1. Complete Config Layer Verification (HIGHEST PRIORITY)

- Ensure all constants are properly defined in config.py
- Check all imports reference these constants
- Remove any hardcoded values

### 2. Complete Utilities Layer Verification

- Verify data_handlers.py for consistent percentage handling
- Check model_utils.py for proper feature validation
- Ensure visualization.py has consistent formatting

### 3. Verify Simulation Logic

- Check bracket advancement logic
- Verify series length distribution application
- Ensure home ice advantage is applied correctly

### 4. Verify Page Implementations

- Check each page for consistent patterns
- Verify error handling and user feedback
- Ensure UI elements are consistent

### 5. Test and Deploy

- Test with real NHL data
- Optimize performance
- Deploy to production

## Initial Verification Tasks

1. Verify config.py contains all required constants:
   - HOME_ICE_ADVANTAGE = 0.039
   - SERIES_LENGTH_DISTRIBUTION = [0.140, 0.243, 0.336, 0.281]
   - Other application constants

2. Verify data_handlers.py for consistent data processing:
   - Percentage storage in 0-1 scale
   - Error handling for data loading
   - Data validation functions

3. Verify model_utils.py for consistent prediction functions:
   - HOME_ICE_ADVANTAGE imported from config.py
   - Feature validation before model application
   - Consistent prediction patterns

By following this bottom-up verification approach, we'll ensure all components work together coherently and consistently, creating a high-quality NHL playoff prediction application.
