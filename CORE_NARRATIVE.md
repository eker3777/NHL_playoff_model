# NHL Playoff Predictor - Core Narrative

## Project Vision
The NHL Playoff Predictor is a data-driven web application that forecasts NHL playoff outcomes through advanced statistical modeling and simulation. Our goal is to provide hockey fans, analysts, and enthusiasts with insights into potential playoff scenarios based on current team performance metrics.

## Current Progress
We've established a solid foundation with:
- ✅ Well-organized modular code structure
- ✅ Separation of concerns with utility modules
- ✅ Consistent page layouts and user flow
- ✅ Robust simulation model framework
- ✅ Centralized configuration approach
- ✅ Caching strategy for performance

## Immediate Focus: Bottom-Up Verification
Our current priority is a systematic bottom-up verification of all components:
1. **Config Layer**: Verify all constants in config.py
2. **Utilities Layer**: Verify all utility modules for consistency and correctness
3. **Simulation Layer**: Verify simulation logic and model application
4. **Page Layer**: Verify each page implements patterns consistently
5. **App Layer**: Verify proper initialization and navigation

This verification will ensure all components work together coherently and consistently.

## Core Functionality
The application offers three main interaction modes:
1. **First Round Matchups**: View predictions for current playoff matchups
2. **Head-to-Head Comparison**: Compare any two teams in a hypothetical series
3. **Bracket Simulator**: Simulate entire playoff brackets with probabilities

Each of these views leverages our predictive model that combines:
- Regular season team statistics
- Historical playoff performance
- Matchup-specific factors
- Home ice advantage considerations

## Technical Approach
Our technical implementation focuses on:
- **Modularity**: Clean separation of concerns for maintainability
- **Consistency**: Standardized patterns across files and functions
- **Performance**: Strategic caching to minimize computation
- **Reliability**: Fallback options and error handling
- **Extensibility**: Easy addition of new features and data sources

## Path to Completion
To reach our launch milestone:
1. Complete bottom-up verification of all components
2. Fix any inconsistencies identified during verification
3. Test with real NHL data
4. Optimize performance
5. Deploy to production environment
