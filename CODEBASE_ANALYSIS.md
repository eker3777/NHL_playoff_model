# NHL Playoff Model - Comprehensive Codebase Analysis

## Executive Summary

This document provides a thorough analysis of the NHL playoff prediction application, identifying structural issues and proposing a bottom-up verification approach. The codebase will be systematically reviewed to ensure consistency in configuration, data handling, simulation, and UI presentation across all components.

## Current Codebase Assessment

### Overall Architecture Issues

1. **Inconsistent Data Handling**: 
   - Data loading, validation, and processing vary across different pages
   - Inconsistent data refresh mechanisms

2. **Duplicated Logic**: 
   - Core prediction and simulation logic repeated with slight variations
   - Multiple implementations of similar functionality

3. **Inconsistent Model Application**: 
   - Home ice advantage (3.9%) applied inconsistently across different functions
   - Feature validation missing in some places

4. **Poor Separation of Concerns**: 
   - UI code mixed with data processing and model logic
   - Lack of clear boundaries between application layers

5. **Inadequate Error Handling**: 
   - Limited fallback mechanisms when data loading fails
   - Poor user feedback when errors occur

6. **Inefficient Caching**: 
   - Simulations may run unnecessarily when data hasn't changed
   - Missing scheduled refresh mechanism

### Current Page Structure Analysis

The application consists of six main pages, each with specific purposes and data dependencies:

1. **first_round.py** - Displays first-round playoff matchups with predictions
2. **simulation_results.py** - Shows aggregated simulation results and championship odds
3. **head_to_head.py** - Allows custom team comparison and matchup prediction
4. **sim_bracket.py** - Facilitates interactive playoff bracket simulation
5. **about.py** - Provides information about methodology and data sources
6. **debug.py** - Offers diagnostic tools for developers

Each page has its own approach to data loading, validation, and prediction, leading to inconsistencies and potential errors.

### Centralized Configuration and Constants

A central `config.py` file will contain all constants, ensuring consistency:

```python
# Constants for prediction and simulation
HOME_ICE_ADVANTAGE = 0.039  # 3.9% boost for home team
SERIES_LENGTH_DIST = [0.140, 0.243, 0.336, 0.281]  # Distribution for 4,5,6,7 games

# Data refresh settings
REFRESH_HOUR = 5  # 5 AM Eastern Time refresh
TIMEZONE = "US/Eastern"

# API settings and endpoints
API_BASE_URL = "..."
API_TIMEOUT = 30  # seconds

# Feature lists for models
CRITICAL_FEATURES = [
    'PP%_rel', 'PK%_rel', 'FO%', 'playoff_performance_score',
    'xGoalsPercentage', 'homeRegulationWin%', 'roadRegulationWin%',
    'possAdjHitsPctg', 'possAdjTakeawaysPctg', 'possTypeAdjGiveawaysPctg',
    'reboundxGoalsPctg', 'goalDiff/G', 'adjGoalsSavedAboveX/60',
    'adjGoalsScoredAboveX/60'
]

# Model features derived from critical features
MODEL_FEATURES = [f"{feature}_diff" for feature in CRITICAL_FEATURES] + ['points_diff']
```

## Detailed Analysis of Issues and Solutions

### 1. Data Processing and Validation

#### Issues:
- Inconsistent data refresh mechanisms
- Percentage columns in wrong format (mix of strings, 0-100 values, 0-1 decimals)
- Silent failures when data is missing or invalid
- Inconsistent data type handling leading to merge issues

#### Solutions:
- Standardize all percentage columns to 0-1 scale
- Implement consistent validation with `validate_and_fix()` function
- Add comprehensive NaN checking with debug output
- Create unified data formatting functions
- Implement proper error handling for API failures
- Add time-based refresh at 5:00 AM Eastern Time

### 2. Model Loading and Application

#### Issues:
- Silent model fallbacks
- Feature engineering inconsistencies between training and prediction
- Missing validation for required features
- Inconsistent application of home ice advantage

#### Solutions:
- Define `HOME_ICE_ADVANTAGE = 0.039` as a module constant in `config.py` and import it everywhere
- Rewrite `predict_series_winner()` to clearly separate raw probabilities from home ice effects
- Add explicit validation for required model features before predictions
- Remove silent fallbacks and add clear error reporting when features are missing
- Standardize feature engineering process between training and prediction
- Ensure critical features are present before model application with validation checks

### 3. Simulation Process

#### Issues:
- Inconsistent application of home ice advantage (values range from 0.035 to 0.04)
- Incorrect series length distribution affecting simulation accuracy
- Bracket advancement logic issues causing invalid playoff progressions
- Inefficient simulation runs causing performance problems

#### Solutions:
- Apply home ice advantage consistently as `HOME_ICE_ADVANTAGE = 0.039` imported from `config.py`
- Implement historically accurate series length distribution from `config.py`:
  - 4 games: 14.0% (0.140)
  - 5 games: 24.3% (0.243)
  - 6 games: 33.6% (0.336)
  - 7 games: 28.1% (0.281)
- Fix bracket advancement logic to follow NHL rules precisely
- Add data quality checks before running simulations to prevent invalid inputs
- Ensure proper home/away game scheduling based on regular season points
- Implement caching for completed simulations to improve performance

### 4. Caching Strategy

#### Issues:
- Simulations run unnecessarily
- No centralized cache management
- Missing cache invalidation

#### Solutions:
- Implement a time-based refresh mechanism at 5:00 AM Eastern Time
- Create centralized cache manager (`cache_manager.py`)
- Add cache invalidation based on data changes
- Implement timestamping for cached data
- Add cache status indicators in the UI

### 5. Error Handling and Debugging

#### Issues:
- Limited debug information
- Silent failures
- Insufficient validation

#### Solutions:
- Enhance debug page with data quality metrics
- Add validation checks for unusual predictions
- Improve debug message formatting
- Create a dedicated debug log
- Implement comprehensive data quality reports
- Add model feature importance visualization
- Implement validation status tracking
