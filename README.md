## Usage

### Basic Prediction Pipeline

Generate predictions for the current NHL season:

```bash
python main.py
```

Generate predictions for a specific season:

```bash
python main.py 2023  # For 2023-2024 season
```

### Output

The system generates:

1. **Markdown Report**: `reports/NHL_Playoff_Report_YYYYZZZZ.md`
2. **Visualizations**: PNG charts in the `reports/` directory
3. **Data Cache**: Processed team data in `data/` directory
4. **Logs**: Execution logs in `nhl_prediction.log`
